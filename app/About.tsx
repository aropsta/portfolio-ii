            Hey, I&apos;m Arob, a Full-Stack Engineer based in Melbourne,

            I focus on building and running production-ready systems that tackle
            real-world business challenges. Coming into software engineering
            through a non-traditional path has given me a different lens‚Äîone
            that‚Äôs grounded in building practical, scalable solutions that
            actually make a difference.
            <br />
            <br />
            Recently, I‚Äôve built and launched a robust price comparison platform
            that pulls in data from some of Australia‚Äôs largest retailers. It
            handles complex product matching, real-time data processing, and
            manages thousands of products every day. The entire system runs on a
            custom Kubernetes setup I designed, with full monitoring,
            resilience, and disaster recovery baked in.
            <br />
            <br />
            My approach combines technical depth with business awareness,
            focusing on solutions that work in production under real
            constraints. From database design and matching algorithms to
            Kubernetes operations and payment processing, I take end-to-end
            ownership of the systems I build, including comprehensive
            documentation for maintainability and disaster recovery.
